    <h1>Brief on wine tea</h1>
     <p><span>Wine Tea</span> is a heady high-fired tea, this black tea packs quite a flavor punch and caffeine kick. Scent of red wine can be experienced throughout the length of the flavor profile of this tea.
        Tea wine is a classic country wine and this recipe gives the recipe and method to make the perfect brew.Caffeine is an important feature of coffee, but coffee contains many compounds, and there are different ways of drinking it.
        Clearing out the spare bedroom last week, I came across an old book of wine recipes from the 1950s. It contained mainly country wine recipes and used no scientific jargon or equipment at all. These were wine recipes from the days when every housewife made her own household wine from whatever fruits and vegetables were in season, with only standard kitchen equipment.
Flicking through it's yellowed pages I came across a wine recipe that used Tea as the main ingredient. Not only does it make wine that is very pleasant to drink ( and which tastes nothing like tea), but it is also quick and easy to make.
This is taken directly from the book.
"Cut up the raisins and slice the lemons thinly, and put them in a large bowl or jug. Add 2lb. of granulated sugar, then pour on four pints of cold tea. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, then cover the bowl or jug and leave it for a month.
After this time you will find a scum on top, remove this carefully, then strain off the liquid and bottle.
Tea wine can be drunk at once, but it is best to keep it a few months first. Keep it in a cool dark place, and don't push the corks in too hard at first.
It sounds strange to make wine from tea, but it does turn out a good wine, tasting not the least like tea. Of course there is no need to make tea especially for this purpose, if you usually throw away half a pot of tea, as I think most people do (this was written in the days before tea-bags), just save this until you have four pints, strain off the tea leaves though.
I suppose the different kinds of tea and the strength of the brew must make some difference to the wine, so yours will probably turn out differently to your neighbour's"
Easy Wine Recipe
So there you have it. Probably one of the easiest wine recipes you will ever come across. No special equipment needed, and if you are brave enough to have a go at the original method, you won't even need to buy yeast.
So if you have ever yearned to make alcohol at home, why not begin with home wine making. It's easy to do and very satisfying - Go on, You know you want to.
